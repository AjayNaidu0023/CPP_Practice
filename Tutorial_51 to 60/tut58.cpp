/*
There is not much difference in this and tut57.cpp the only difference is 
in this we have used Pure Virtual function inside class

******* Pure Virtual Class *******

Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the function is 
declared by assigning the value 0 to it. Pure virtual functions are declared in abstract 
classes.

******* Abstract base Class *******
Abstract base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. 
The classes which are inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of 
the abstract class otherwise compiler will throw an error.
